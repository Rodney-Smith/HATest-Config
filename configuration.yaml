# Configure a default setup of Home Assistant (frontend, api, etc)
# Including Directories
# !include_dir_list will return the content of a directory as a list with each file content being an entry in the list. The list entries are ordered based on the alphanumeric ordering of the names of the files.
# !include_dir_named will return the content of a directory as a dictionary which maps filename => content of file.
# !include_dir_merge_list will return the content of a directory as a list by merging all files (which should contain a list) into 1 big list.
# !include_dir_merge_named will return the content of a directory as a dictionary by loading each file and merging it into 1 big dictionary.
